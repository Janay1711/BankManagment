# BankManagment
Here's an explanation of the provided C++ code line by line:

1. `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the input/output stream library, allowing input and output operations to be performed in the program.

2. `#include <vector>`: This line includes the vector container class template, which provides dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink in size.

3. `#include <string>`: This line includes the string class, allowing the use of strings in the program.

4. `using namespace std;`: This line indicates that the program is using the standard namespace. It means that names from the standard C++ library (like `cin`, `cout`, `vector`, etc.) can be used without specifying the namespace each time.

5. `struct Account { ... };`: This line defines a structure named `Account` containing three data members: `account_number` of type `int`, `name` of type `string`, and `balance` of type `float`.

6. Function prototypes:
   - `void create_account(vector<Account> &accounts);`: Prototype for a function that creates a new bank account.
   - `void deposit(vector<Account> &accounts);`: Prototype for a function that allows depositing money into an account.
   - `void withdraw(vector<Account> &accounts);`: Prototype for a function that allows withdrawing money from an account.
   - `void view_account(const vector<Account> &accounts);`: Prototype for a function that displays account details.

7. `int main() { ... }`: The main function, the entry point of the program, where the execution of the program begins.

8. `int choice;`: Declares an integer variable `choice` to store the user's menu choice.

9. `vector<Account> accounts;`: Declares a vector named `accounts` that holds objects of the `Account` structure.

10. `while (true) { ... }`: Starts an infinite loop, displaying a menu and processing user choices until the user chooses to exit.

11. Inside the loop, the program displays a menu with options for creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, viewing account details, and exiting the program.

12. `cin >> choice;`: Reads the user's choice from the standard input.

13. `switch (choice) { ... }`: Switch statement to perform actions based on the user's choice.

14. `case 1: create_account(accounts); break;`: Calls the `create_account` function when the user chooses to create an account.

15. `case 2: deposit(accounts); break;`: Calls the `deposit` function when the user chooses to deposit money.

16. `case 3: withdraw(accounts); break;`: Calls the `withdraw` function when the user chooses to withdraw money.

17. `case 4: view_account(accounts); break;`: Calls the `view_account` function when the user chooses to view account details.

18. `case 5: ... exit(0);`: Exits the program when the user chooses option 5.

19. `void create_account(vector<Account> &accounts) { ... }`: Definition of the function to create a new bank account. It prompts the user for account details and adds the account to the `accounts` vector.

20. `void deposit(vector<Account> &accounts) { ... }`: Definition of the function to deposit money into an account. It prompts the user for the account number and deposit amount and updates the account balance.

21. `void withdraw(vector<Account> &accounts) { ... }`: Definition of the function to withdraw money from an account. It prompts the user for the account number and withdrawal amount and updates the account balance if sufficient funds are available.

22. `void view_account(const vector<Account> &accounts) { ... }`: Definition of the function to view account details. It prompts the user for the account number and displays the account information if found in the `accounts` vector.

23. The functions `create_account`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `view_account` are defined according to their respective prototypes, implementing the logic explained in the prototypes.

This code provides a basic banking management system where users can create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and view account details. It utilizes a vector to store account information and a menu-driven approach for user interactions.
